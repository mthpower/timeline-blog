        <h2>Entry Title</h2>
        Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! Itall makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
